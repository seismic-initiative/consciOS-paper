Green (directly relevant; cite early in Section 3)
- Albarracin et al., 2024 — “Feeling our place in the world: an active inference account of self‑esteem” (Neuroscience of Consciousness). Directly maps active‑inference accounts of self & layered self-modeling → supports the Super‑Self / Echo‑Self mapping. (Place: Section 3.1 / 3.2)
- Darling et al., 2025 — “Solving the relevance problem with predictive processing” (Philosophical Psychology). Direct theoretical support for relevance realization / selection (resonance engine parallels). (Place: Section 3.2 / 5.1)
- Friston / active inference literature (referenced in codex — include Friston et al. refs). Foundational for mapping resonance → inference → selector behavior. (Place: Section 3.2 / 5.1)
- Beer / Viable System Model & Checkland (VSM/cybernetics) — classic systems foundations for nested control; anchors the paper’s systems framing and mapping of Echo/Super/Meta to VSM levels. (Place: Section 3.3 / 4.1)
- Hierarchical RL literature (Janssen et al. 2022; hierarchical RL surveys in codex) — supports meta/meta‑controller and policy‑selection architecture (Meta‑Self / Super‑Self analogues). (Place: Section 3.3 / 4.4)
- Interoception & affect reviews (e.g., Lazzarelli et al. 2024/2025 integrative review) — supports using interoception (EGS) as a measurable feedback channel. (Place: Section 3.4 / Appendix measurement)
