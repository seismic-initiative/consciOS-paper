# A Targeted Literature Review for a Systems Architecture of Human/AI Alignment

## Executive Summary of Key Literature

This report begins with a ranked summary of the twelve most relevant academic papers identified through a targeted literature search. The ranking prioritizes publications that most directly bridge computational control models (from cybernetics, AI, and reinforcement learning) with the sciences of affect, consciousness, and self-regulation. Each entry provides a concise overview and its suggested placement within the ConsciOS theoretical framework. A detailed analysis integrating these and other foundational sources follows in the main body of the report.

Intrinsic proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the Self, others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and proactively prioritizing human well-being. The integration of externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment will co-shape symbiotic values and rules through iterative human-ASI co-alignment, paving the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and for a symbiotic ecology.
7. **Human Summary:** This paper moves beyond traditional AI alignment by proposing an intrinsic, proactive alignment rooted in self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy—core functions of the ConsciOS Meta-Self. It provides a high-level justification for why a consciousness-inspired architecture is critical for advanced AI safety.

2. **Authors:** Miriam Janssen, Christopher LeWarne, Diana Burk, Bruno B. Averbeck

6. **Abstract:** To effectively behave within ever-changing environments, biological agents must learn and act at varying hierarchical levels such that a complex task may be broken down into more tractable subtasks. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a computational framework that provides an understanding of this process by combining sequential actions into one temporally extended unit called an option. However, there are still open questions within the HRL framework, including how options are formed and how HRL mechanisms might be realized within the brain. In this review, we propose that the existing human motor sequence literature can aid in understanding both of these questions. We give specific emphasis to visuomotor sequence learning tasks such as the discrete sequence production task and the M × N (M steps × N sets) task to understand how hierarchical learning and behavior manifest across sequential action tasks as well as how the dorsal cortical–subcortical circuitry could support this kind of behavior. This review highlights how motor chunks within a motor sequence can function as HRL options. Furthermore, we aim to merge findings from motor sequence literature with reinforcement learning perspectives to inform experimental design in each respective subfield.
7. **Human Summary:** This review grounds the hierarchical architecture of ConsciOS in neurobiology, explaining how HRL models the way biological agents decompose complex tasks. It provides a strong scientific basis for using a hierarchical control structure in an AI agent intended to mirror human-like intelligence.
8. **Methods:** Literature review bridging computational HRL with cognitive neuroscience and motor control research.

6. **Abstract:** It is increasingly recognized that interoceptive...source the Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) compute flexible intentions—or motor plans from a belief over targets—to dynamically generate goal-directed actions, and we develop a computational formalization of this process. A proof-of-concept agent embodying visual and proprioceptive sensors and an actuated upper limb was tested on target-reaching tasks. The agent behaved correctly under various conditions, including static and dynamic targets, different sensory feedbacks, sensory precisions, intention gains, and movement policies; limit conditions were individuated, too. Active Inference driven by dynamic and flexible intentions can thus support goal-directed behavior in constantly changing environments, and the PPC might putatively host its core intention mechanism. More broadly, the study provides a normative computational basis for research on goal-directed behavior in end-to-end settings and further advances mechanistic theories of active biological systems.
7. **Human Summary:** This paper provides a concrete computational model of goal-directed action within the active inference framework. It formalizes how high-level intentions are translated into low-level motor control, a key process for the ConsciOS agent's ability to act on its decisions.
8. **Methods:** Computational simulation of a robotic agent performing target-reaching tasks.

6. **Abstract:** Declining mental health is a prominent and...source and may not accurately capture the unique emotional patterns of each person. This study explored the performance of...source using McNemar statistics. Model runtime was also used as an efficiency metric. The personalised approach consistently outperformed the generalised method across both datasets. McNemar's test revealed significant improvements in all but one machine learning algorithm. This research concludes that smaller, personalised models are a far more effective way of conducting affective classification, and this was validated with both small (MUSE) and large (DEAP) datasets consisting of EEG samples from 4 to 32 subjects, respectively.
7. **Human Summary:** This study provides a practical, empirical method for implementing a key component of the EGS: the classification of affective states from physiological signals. It demonstrates that discretized emotional states (arousal/valence) can be effectively identified from EEG data, supporting the feasibility of building such a system.
8. **Methods:** Empirical study using machine learning algorithms to classify affective states from two public EEG datasets (MUSE and DEAP).

1. **Title:** Ascribing consciousness to artificial intelligence: human-AI interaction and its carry-over effects on human-human interaction
2. **Authors:** Rose E. Guingrich, Michael S. A. Graziano
3. **Year:** 2024
4. **Venue:** Frontiers in Psychology

6. **Abstract:** The question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) can be considered conscious and therefore should be evaluated through a moral lens has surfaced in recent years. In this paper, we argue that whether AI is conscious is less of a concern than the fact that AI can be considered conscious by users during human-AI interaction, because this ascription of consciousness can lead to carry-over effects on human-human interaction. When AI is viewed as conscious like a human, then how people treat AI appears to carry over into how they treat other people due to activating schemas that are congruent to those activated during interactions with humans. In light of this potential, we might consider regulating how we treat AI, or how we build AI to evoke certain kinds of treatment from users, but not because AI is inherently sentient. This argument focuses on humanlike, social actor AI such as chatbots, digital voice assistants, and social robots. In the first part of the paper, we provide evidence for carry-over effects between perceptions of AI consciousness and behavior toward humans through literature on human-computer interaction, human-AI interaction, and the psychology of artificial agents. In the second part of the paper, we detail how the mechanism of schema activation can allow us to test consciousness perception as a driver of carry-over effects between human-AI interaction and human-human interaction. In essence, perceiving AI as conscious like a human, thereby activating congruent mind schemas during interaction, is a driver for behaviors and perceptions of AI that can carry over into how we treat humans. Therefore, the fact that people can ascribe humanlike consciousness to AI is worth considering, and moral protection for AI is also worth considering, regardless of AI’s inherent conscious or moral status.
7. **Human Summary:** This paper highlights the critical importance of building AI that appears conscious and is treated ethically, regardless of its "true" phenomenal state. It argues that the way humans interact with AI has carry-over effects on human-human interaction, making the design of aligned, "conscious-like" agents a societal imperative.
