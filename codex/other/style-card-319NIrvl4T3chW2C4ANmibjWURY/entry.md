Use this as the single source of truth for voice, terminology, and claim labeling across the ConsciOS whitepaper and related docs.
1. Voice and stance
   - Confident, tech-savvy, systems-savvy, rigorous, credible, clear, practical, empowering, systematic,
   - Anti-establishment but constructive,
   - Inspiring, empowering, urgent yet patient,
   - Bridging theory with practical application - showing readers where their real power lies and how to use it effectively,
   - Inviting - establishing scientific legitimacy while maintaining accessibility and encouraging experimentation.
2. Stance: model-first humility; “try this and measure” over “believe this.”
3. Sentence style: short to medium; one idea per paragraph;
4. Reader address: you. Use we sparingly (for shared moves).
5. Avoid: absolutist metaphysical claims; vague spiritual filler; academic hedging.

2. Canonical terms and capitalization

- Echo‑Self, Super‑Self, Meta‑Self
- Kernel (heart-centered controller)
- Emotional Guidance Scale (EGS)
- Resonance Engine
- FREQ Coin
- The 7 Flows
- The Iceberg
- Parallel VR Engine
- Quality Control
- Option‑Availability
- Use US English. Keep the non‑breaking hyphen in Echo‑/Super‑/Meta‑Self.

3. Claims labels and how to use them

- [Mechanism]: Convergent science or robust practice supports it (e.g., feedback loops, interoception, attention shaping perception).
- [Analogy]: A mapping to aid understanding (VR game, slides/frames, currency).
- [Hypothesis]: Testable proposition; provide a protocol.

Usage:
- Place tags at the end of a key sentence or in the section header.
- Example: “You don’t force scenes; you tune them. Frequency is the selector. [Hypothesis]”
- Upgrade tags if/when evidence strengthens.

4. Tense, numbers, formatting

- Tense: present and near-future.
- Numbers: use numerals (2–5 minutes, 60–120 seconds).
- Lists: bullets; keep items parallel and concise.
- Dates: Month DD, YYYY in narrative; ISO (YYYY‑MM‑DD) for metadata.
- Acronyms: define on first use; then use the acronym consistently.
- Quotes: include only if verified; otherwise rephrase without attribution.

5. Section patterns

- Begin with a plain-language promise or “why it matters.”
- Resolve every concept into an action or protocol.
- End each major section with a Try This box.

6. Try This box template

Try This: [Name]

Time: [e.g., 2–5 minutes]

Goal: [state change or outcome]

Steps:
1. …
2. …
3. …

Measure:
- Before/After ratings (mood 1–10, clarity 1–10)
- Note option‑availability (how many viable actions can you see?)

Notes:
- Safety cues or common pitfalls.

Model status: [Mechanism/Analogy/Hypothesis]
7. Callouts

- Systems Note: engineer’s bridge (VSM/control theory/predictive processing tie-in).
- Story Box: brief anecdote for human context (3–6 lines).
- Caution: anti‑pitfall (e.g., “Don’t skip the 60–120s hold; it encodes the state.”)

8. Diagram conventions

- Clean line-art; consistent labels; minimal color accents.
- Captions: Figure X. Title — one-sentence takeaway.
- Labels mirror glossary terms exactly.

9. Diction to prefer/avoid

Prefer: coherence, selector, render, stabilize, protocol, measure, iterate, leverage, actuator, feedback, constraint.

Avoid: manifesting (use create/tune), vibration (use frequency/coherence), magic/spooky, guru language.
10. Default phrases

- “Nearest lighter step” for EGS micro‑moves.
- “Nearest Lighter Step (NLS)” as the human-facing phrase, and add an engineering alias “Least‑Resistance Step (LRS)” for Systems Notes. We can also describe it as “a local coherence gradient step” when speaking to engineers. This keeps warmth and precision.
- Locked: Imagineer → Refine → Hold. In prose, we can say “Imagine/Feel/Become” as a synonym, but the standardized label in headings/diagrams will be Imagineer → Refine → Hold.
- “Imagine → Feel → Become” is acceptable; standardize as “Imagineer → Refine → Hold” if used, but do not promise time-boxed outcomes.
