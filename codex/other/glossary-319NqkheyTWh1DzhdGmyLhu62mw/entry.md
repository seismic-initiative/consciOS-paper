Canonical definitions for ConsciOS terms. Use exactly these spellings and meanings.
- Echo‑Self: The embodied avatar (I‑AM‑THIS) living inside rendered scenes; operates with limited bandwidth and latency. Reads guidance and takes actions.
- Super‑Self: The presence/controller (I‑AM) that matches active frequency to pre‑rendered scenes; communicates via haptic guidance (feelings) and attention nudges.
- Meta‑Self: The infinite substrate (I level) that patterns all possibilities; exposes resonance laws; does not micromanage.
- Kernel: The heart-centered control point (felt‑sense interface) the Echo‑Self uses to read guidance and adjust state.
- Emotional Guidance Scale (EGS): A ladder UI of emotion bands from despair to joy; used as haptic feedback. Move one reachable rung toward relief (“nearest lighter step”).
- Resonance Engine: The selection mechanism that renders the scene matching the stabilized frequency/coherence.
- FREQ Coin: Currency metaphor for sustained coherent frequency over time; “minted” by stabilizing higher‑band states.
- Quality Control: The natural surfacing of misaligned beliefs when you stabilize a higher state; treat as prompts for revision, not failure.
- Parallel VR Engine: The library of pre‑rendered frames/timelines; you don’t force outcomes—you tune which frame renders.
- Ego Autopilot: Safety subsystem that takes over when awareness drops; disengages through Kernel reconnection and EGS moves.
- The 7 Flows: Systems diagram of Inputs, Processes, Outputs, Feedback, Actors, External Constraints, Internal Constraints, mapped to the awareness model.
- The Iceberg: Systems model where beliefs (deep) encode structures that generate patterns that produce events (visible).
- Option‑Availability: The set of viable actions perceptible from your current state; expands with coherence.
- Imagineer → Refine → Hold: Three-stage creation loop: imagine vividly, refine narrative/belief to remove friction, hold the state 60–120 seconds to encode.
- Nearest Lighter Step (NLS): The smallest reachable upward move on the EGS that produces a felt reduction in tension and slight increase in ease/clarity. Primary user-facing term.
- Least‑Resistance Step (LRS): Engineering alias for NLS, emphasizing local optimization (“coherence gradient ascent”). Used in Systems Notes and team protocols.
