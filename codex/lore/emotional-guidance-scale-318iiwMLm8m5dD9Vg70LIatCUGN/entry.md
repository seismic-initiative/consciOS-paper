[This file describes the typical "emotional guidance scale" layout and connects it to frequency and game mechanics.]

## What the picture looks like (in words)

- Imagine a vertical ladder or thermometer divided into bands from top (light/bright) to bottom (dark/dense).

- Each band is labeled with a cluster of emotions arranged from highest to lowest well‑being.

- Top bands: Joy, Love, Appreciation, Empowerment, Freedom.

- Upper‑middle: Passion, Enthusiasm, Positive Expectation, Optimism, Hopefulness, Contentment.

- Middle: Boredom → Pessimism → Frustration/Irritation/Impatience → Overwhelm → Disappointment → Doubt → Worry.

- Lower‑middle: Blame → Discouragement → Anger → Revenge → Hatred/Rage → Jealousy.

- Bottom bands: Insecurity/Guilt/Unworthiness → Fear/Grief/Depression/Despair/Powerlessness.

- A side arrow often runs bottom→top reading “feel better,” “higher vibration,” or “raise frequency.”

## How to read it (frequency view)

- Emotions are not moral labels; they are signal strengths in your guidance system.

- Higher bands = higher frequency/coherence (expansive, resource‑rich states). Lower bands = lower frequency/incoherence (contracted, scarce states).

- The goal is not to pretend; it’s to move one reachable step up the scale. From anger, reach discouragement or blame first; from worry, aim for doubt or disappointment, then up.

## Mapping to the VR game mechanics

- Kernel (Heart) = main controller. Expansion sensations (“open, warm, ease”) signal upward movement; contraction (“tight, cold, stuck”) signals downward movement.

- Emotional Guidance System (EGS) = haptic feedback. Your emotion is the real‑time pointer to which parallel scene you’re tuning.

- FREQ Coin = sustained time in higher bands. You mint coin by stabilizing coherent feelings and narratives.

- Resonance Engine (Super‑Self) = renders scenes that match your current band. Shift band → new scene selection.

- Quality Control = when you hold a higher band, misaligned beliefs surface. Treat them as prompts to tweak assumptions, not as failure.

## How to use the scale (practical protocol)

1) Notice and name where you are on the scale without judgment.

2) Breathe into the Kernel; ask for the “nearest lighter step.”

3) Choose a reachable narrative/action that slightly relieves tension (e.g., from worry → “I’ve handled things like this before”).

4) Hold the new feeling for 60–120 seconds; let the body memorize it.

5) Repeat small climbs, then act from the highest stable band you can hold.

## Design notes (systems perspective)

- The scale is a human‑readable UI over an underlying control loop: intent (set point) → sensation (sensor) → appraisal/belief (controller) → choice/attention (actuator) → rendered scene (plant) → new sensation (feedback).

- Because guidance is continuous, tiny adjustments compound. Micro‑shifts in frequency change option‑availability and creativity.

## Why this matters now

- As AI amplifies collective patterns, our frequency hygiene becomes a leverage point. Using the scale as instrumentation helps align inner state with wise action, reducing reactivity and improving world‑model accuracy.

## One‑line takeaway

The Emotional Guidance Scale is a step‑ladder UI for your inner operating system: feelings are haptic feedback; climb one rung at a time to raise frequency, mint FREQ Coin, and let the engine render better scenes.
