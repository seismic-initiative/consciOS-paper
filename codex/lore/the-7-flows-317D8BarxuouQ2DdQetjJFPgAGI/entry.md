[I will provide actual drawing in the final copy]

## What the drawing will show (in words)
- Inputs: Resources/information/intent that enter the system.

- Processes: The transformation steps that turn inputs into results.

- Outputs: The results produced (states, events, artifacts).

- Feedback: Signals about performance that loop back to adjust behavior.

- Actors: Agents that operate or influence the processes.

- External constraints: Environment limits and rules the system must respect.

- Internal constraints: Policies, beliefs, capacities, and bottlenecks inside the system.

### **How the drawing depicts it (in words)**

- A central box labeled Processes.

- Arrow from the left: Inputs → into the box.

- Two arrows from above into the box: External constraints and Internal constraints.

- Arrow from the bottom into the box: Actors.

- Two lines on the right leaving the box: Outputs; below it Feedback (shown as a loop) returning to influence the next cycle.

### **Mapping to the Infinity Diagram (consciousness-as-system)**

- Inputs → Prime Desire/Intent of the Infinite (Meta-Self) and patterned possibilities.

- Processes → Super-Self resonance-selection (the “rendering engine” that matches frequency to scenes).

- Outputs → Experienced scenes in I‑AM‑THIS (Echo-Self’s lived reality).

- Feedback → Emotional Guidance/haptics via the Kernel (heart), surfacing belief mismatches.

- Actors → Echo-Self (avatar), plus collaborating agents.

- External constraints → Laws of resonance, free agency, physical world conditions.

- Internal constraints → Beliefs, attention habits, ego‑autopilot; skill/capacity limits.

### **Why this unifies metaphysics with engineering**

- Consciousness fits a viable control loop: objective (coherence/Prime Desire), sensors (feelings/feedback), controller (Super‑Self), plant (rendered world), actuators (attention/choice), state (beliefs/frequency).

- This lets us analyze leverage points, measure progress (stabilized frequency/FREQ Coin), and iterate—just like any well‑designed system.

One‑liner: Consciousness can be modeled as a feedback‑controlled system where intent patterns inputs, resonance selects processes, lived reality is the output, and feelings provide the feedback needed to refine beliefs and choices—exactly the structure shown in the seven‑component diagram.
