# 7 Components of A System

## What the picture looks like (in words)
- The background is black with bright teal and white text.
- Big title at the top left: “7 Components of Any Engine.”
- A sentence below the title says: “Arrows represent critical decisions & actions that create leverage.”
- On the left there’s a large teal magnifying glass labeled “Level 5 ZOOM” with “x5.0” inside it.
- In the center is a large rectangle labeled “Business Processes.” Think of it as the workspace where the work happens.
- An arrow from the left points into the box and says “INPUTS.”
- Two arrows drop down from above into the top of the box: “EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS” and “INTERNAL CONSTRAINTS.”
- On the right side two arrows leave the box: the top says “OUTPUTS,” and below it another line says “FEEDBACK” with a small two‑arrow loop icon, hinting that feedback goes out and comes back.
- From the bottom an arrow labeled “ACTORS” points up into the box — meaning people are involved.

## What the seven parts mean (simple)
1) Inputs: What you start with — time, money, materials, information, ideas.
2) Business Processes: The steps where work is actually done; how inputs are turned into results.
3) Outputs: What comes out at the end — the product, service, or outcome.
4) Feedback: Signals about how it went — customer reactions, measurements, comments — used to adjust next time.
5) Actors: The people who do the work or influence it.
6) External Constraints: Limits from the outside world — laws, market conditions, tools you don’t control.
7) Internal Constraints: Limits inside your own setup — policies, skills, budgets, bottlenecks.

## What the arrows mean
- Arrows show where important choices and actions are made. Changing what flows along an arrow can give you big improvements with small moves (leverage).
- The feedback line reminds you to listen, learn, and loop the learning back into the next round.
- The magnifying glass suggests “zoom in” on key areas to find leverage — especially what’s coming in (inputs) and how the work is done (processes).

## A simple everyday example (cooking a meal)
- Inputs: Ingredients, time, recipe, tools.
- Business Processes: Washing, chopping, cooking, plating.
- Outputs: The finished meal.
- Feedback: Taste, smiles (or frowns), “too salty,” “needs more sauce.”
- Actors: You, and anyone helping.
- External Constraints: Store hours, ingredient prices, oven limitations.
- Internal Constraints: Your budget, cooking skills, the size of your kitchen.

Use the feedback to tweak the next meal: buy fresher veggies (input), pre‑chop earlier (process), season as you go (process), or pick a simpler recipe (constraint management).

## One‑line takeaway
Any engine — from dinner to a business — runs on inputs, people, and processes, shaped by constraints, producing outputs, and guided by feedback; the arrows show where small, smart decisions create big positive change.
