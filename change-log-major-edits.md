Change Log (major edits)
Fixed title typo (“Achitecture” → “Architecture”) and standardized capitalization.
Rewrote Abstract to lead with problem→contribution; removed draft/alternative blocks; preserved [Mechanism/Hypothesis] and [CITATION NEEDED].
Enforced canonical‑term‑first usage on first occurrence: embodied controller (Echo‑Self), supervisory controller (Super‑Self), meta‑controller (Meta‑Self); also Kernel/Ego Autopilot and agent‑architecture bullets.
Inserted figure placeholders with one‑line captions (Figures 1–5) for Iceberg, 7‑component model, Infinity Diagram, Resonance Engine, and EGS.
Neutralized informal prompts: replaced TL;DR one‑liners with formal “Summary” sentences in Sections 8.5, 9.4, and 10.
Moved “Three checks” editorial call‑outs from main text to Appendix C (new subsection C.1) to preserve academic tone.
Improved transitions and concision across sections; reduced redundancy and tightened sentences for IEEE style.
Clarified Option‑Availability definition and related measures; kept [Hypothesis] labeling.
Standardized notation in selection rules and pseudocode; ensured consistent symbols (Π, E[·], τ, λ).
Canonical mapping list reformatted to canonical‑first (Echo/Super/Meta) with status tags preserved.
Kernel/Ego Autopilot section rewritten for canonical‑first naming and clearer safety framing.
Verified no Mermaid blocks in manuscript; none required repair.
Preserved all [CITATION NEEDED] placeholders and all [Mechanism]/[Hypothesis]/[Analogy] tags unchanged.
