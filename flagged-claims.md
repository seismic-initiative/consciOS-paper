Composite selection rule blending expected utility and coherence for the Resonance Engine (weighting α, β, γ) requires grounding and comparative evidence. [CITATION NEEDED]
EGS as an effective intrinsic reward/shaping signal and as a short‑horizon predictor of policy switching in humans. [CITATION NEEDED]
FREQ Coin as a time‑integrated coherence resource that gates access to higher‑cost policy families; monotonic relation d|A_eff|/dFREQ > 0. [CITATION NEEDED]
Kernel proxies (HRV, EEG coherence) as real‑time coherence estimators suitable for online control and gating. [CITATION NEEDED]
Quality Control dynamics equated with precision‑weighted prediction error minimizing misaligned priors after frame holding. [CITATION NEEDED]
Infinity Diagram’s explicit mapping to VSM governance layers (S1–S5) as an operational design for cognitive systems. [CITATION NEEDED]
