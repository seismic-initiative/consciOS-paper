# Otonom Home Page — Summary (for Seismic Fund reuse)

Source: [Otonom Home](https://www.otonom.fund/)

- **Positioning**: Blockchain‑powered funding and acceleration launchpad for AI ventures; tech‑first, selection + bootcamp + launch + scaling.
- **Process (How it works)**: Application → Pre‑Selection (scientific + AI‑powered) → Training & Acceleration (bootcamp + 1:1) → Launch (tiered, global rounds) → Scaling (ongoing support).
- **Value props**:
  - Startups: global stage, AI Startup Bootcamp, mentor network (“board of visionaries”), community (Otonom Collective).
  - Individual investors: early access to curated AI ventures; transparent, tokenized participation.
  - Corporate investors: strategic access to cutting‑edge AI, innovation integration, market leadership.
  - Ecosystem: bridge local genius to global impact; ethical/impactful AI.
- **Operating claims**: AI‑augmented operations (speed/precision/efficiency/future-powered) reduce overhead and increase throughput.
- **Community**: invite to Discord; DAO/token model referenced; governance via $OFUND (community‑driven).

Notes for Seismic reuse:
- Map “Otonom Collective/DAO/$OFUND” → “Seismic Community/Seismic DAO/Fund token (TBD)”.
- Replace “AI Startup Bootcamp” → “ConsciOS Startups (Launchpad)”.
- Align selection transparency with ConsciOS logging/metrics (selection traces, OA, FREQ).
