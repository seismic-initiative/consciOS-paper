# Spaghetti Startup (2014) — Summary for ConsciOS Startups

Source: [Spaghetti Startup — Han Kay](https://www.otonom.fund/spaghetti-startup-book-by-han-kay)

- **Theme**: pragmatic startup building under uncertainty; systems‑aware entrepreneurship.
- **Ideas to port**: iterate fast with measurable learning; reduce waste via feedback loops; make constraints visible; structured experimentation; founder mindset.
- **As a textbook**: adopt as foundational reading for ConsciOS Startups (Launchpad) with modules mapped to telemetry (selection traces, OA, coherence, FREQ) and governance (safety, ethics).
- **Bridging**: connect narrative heuristics from the book to formal ConsciOS metrics and ablations (what to log; how to compare).

Notes:
- Pair chapters with runnable notebooks/examples that use the demo repo to illustrate concepts.
