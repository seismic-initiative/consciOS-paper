Rework the Abstract to lead with the problem statement and the paper's core contribution before introducing new terminology.

Provide Figure placeholders: Figure 1 = ConsciOS Architecture (Infinity Diagram couples Meta/Super/Echo with Kernel, Resonance Engine, EGS, Parallel VR Engine); Figure 2 = Iceberg → 7‑Component mapping diagram; Figure 3 = Resonance Engine loop (Imagineer→Refine→Hold pseudocode flow). Keep Mermaid code markers for each figure so we can later generate the diagrams.

Add a short “Visuals to include” caption list to suggest the mermaid diagrams needed, with one‑line figure captions.

Manage the “jargon footprint”: While the dual-labeling system is excellent, the sheer number of newly capitalized terms (Kernel, FREQ Coin, Quality Control, Parallel VR Engine, Ego Autopilot) can feel like a private language. This can sometimes create resistance in a skeptical academic audience. Keep canonical term first, alias second (parenthetical). Do not introduce additional new branded terms.

Remove internal notes (TL;DR boxes used for drafting may remain as comments but do not appear in the final manuscript).

Rephrase any sentence that reads like instruction to the reader (e.g., “Try This” boxes) into neutral academic description or move such content to Appendix C (Public Translation).

Ethical and Safety Emphasis: The draft correctly identifies ethical concerns, but given the sensitive nature of using physiological and emotional data, a more robust discussion of potential risks, mitigation strategies, and the importance of informed consent would be beneficial. It's crucial to demonstrate a strong commitment to responsible research.
